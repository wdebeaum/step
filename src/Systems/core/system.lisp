;;;; Code for defining, loading, and running TRIPS systems.
;;;; Load this file, then define your system with DEF-TRIPS-SYSTEM,
;;;; load it with LOAD-TRIPS-SYSTEM, and run it with RUN-TRIPS-SYSTEM.
;;;; These have to be separate functions to support running in both
;;;; test mode (see test.lisp) and for real from a dump.
;;;;
;;;; See comments in RESTART-TRIPS-SYSTEM about verbose logging.
