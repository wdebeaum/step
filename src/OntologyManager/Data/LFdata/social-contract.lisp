;; Working on the social-contract hierarchy,
;; I ended up with `essential-contract` and `nonessential-contract` under
;; `social-imperative`, but also `external/internal-authority` under `governing-principle`.
;; However, it seems that we can do away with those nodes if we introduce a feature or
;; something like `authority-source` which can have values such as `internal, external`
;; and even `religious`.

;;; interactions between individuals and society
