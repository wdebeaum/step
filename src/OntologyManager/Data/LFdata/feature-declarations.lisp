; Myrosia 2005
;F::Information-content is the top-level value for feature f::information, to 
;contrast with "-". Currently it is further split into two subcategories:
;f::data and f::mental-construct. Generally speaking, "f::data" should be set 
;on things like "book" or "prescription", which are data or contain it. 
;"F::mental-construct" should be for something like "formula" which 
;corresponds to something that contains information but less directly. Before 
;there used to be another value, "f::event", which corresponded to events and 
;states. This was because of the sense that events contain information in some 
;sense (they can be explained or summarized), but not the same as data 
;objects. I now see that all events have been switched to "information 
;f::mental-construct", I don't remember when it happened and why. 
;"f::information-content" is a supertype over both "data" and 
;"mental-construct" when a better type could not be assigned.
