<h1>Running TRIPS</h1>

<p>Basic instructions for running TRIPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Run "<code><var>$TRIPS_BASE</var>/bin/trips-<var>system</var></code>", where <code><var>$TRIPS_BASE</var></code> is
   the directory containing the "<code>src</code>", "<code>bin</code>", and
   "<code>etc</code>" directories, and <code><var>system</var></code> is the name of the specific TRIPS system you installed (e.g. <code>cogent</code>).
<li>
   If you have moved the installed system from the configured
   location, you must specify the new prefix by setting
   the <code><var>$TRIPS_BASE</var></code> environment variable prior to launching the
   system.
<li>
   A log directory will be created in whatever directory you ran trips
   from (or you can specify where by setting the environment
   variable <code><var>$TRIPS_LOGS</var></code> prior to running the system). Many
   people create a <code>tmp</code> or <code>log</code> directory somewhere and then create a
   symlink from that directory to the command to run TRIPS.
</ul>

   in <a href="trips-devel.html">trips-devel.html</a> for
   alternate ways of running TRIPS during development.</p>
