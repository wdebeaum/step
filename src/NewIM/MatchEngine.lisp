;;  General LF graph Matching facility to perform extraction and/or inference

;;  Rules consist of
;;      Input  - LF terms that match the input
;;      Context Patterns - which match the input but do not "consume" it. There are three
;;         types of contextual patterns
;;              (- X) ---  pattern X  must NOT match the input
;;              CALL procedure calls to arbitrary lisp functions, which return a binding list if they succeed
;;     Output - the new transformed expressions that correspond to the content in the input
