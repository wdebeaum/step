  "Defines TRIPS component NAME. This does several things:

1. Defines a new package named PACKAGE (defaults to NAME).
   - This package will be defined to use any packages given as USE. The
     default is (:common-lisp), and the use of the DEFCOMPONENT package is
     added automatically regardless of the value of this argument. The
     created package will export those symbols given on EXPORT.

2. Defines a new mk:defsystem named NAME from the specification SYSTEM.
   - If this specification does not contain a :source-pathname specifier,
     one will be provided based on the location of the file containing the
     DEFCOMPONENT form.

3. Defines an instance of CLASS (which should be a subclass of TRIPS-COMPONENT)
   named NAME, with the new system and package as attributes.

4. Defines several functions in the newly-created package for use
   by the component. These typically encapsulate a call to a component
   method with the new component, so that user code doesn't have to
   keep track of the components.

5. Call IN-PACKAGE on the new package and IN-COMPONENT on the new component,
   to simplify code following the DEFCOMPONENT form.

Use DEFCOMPONENT-METHOD to augment or override the standard component
methods (COMPILE-COMPONENT, LOAD-COMPONENT, etc.).

Use DEFCOMPONENT-HANDLER to add message handlers for the component."
