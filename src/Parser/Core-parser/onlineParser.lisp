;;
;;  A SERIAL BU PARSER FOR USE IN SPEECH APPLICATIONS, WHERE WORDS
;;   appear incrementally and sentence boundaries are not explicit.

;;  Notes on the basic best-first bottom-up parsing algorithm.
;;    This uses a best-first to build a chart 
;;    To run the parser, you must have made a lexicon and grammar "active" using the
;;    functions make-grammar and make-lexicon. (see file "GrammarandLexicon" for code)
;;
;;  e.g.,  Here is a sample session, assuming *lexicon1* and *grammar1* are
;;              appropriately defined
;;          (make-lexicon *lexicon1*)
;;          (make-grammar *grammar1*)
;;

;;  There are two functions to invoke the parser.

;;  START-BU-PARSE initializes the chart and then runs the parser on
;;      the words that it is passed. e.g. (start-BU-parse '(the train))

;;  CONTINUE-BU-PARSE continues the parse with additional words,
;;     e.g., (continue-BU-parse '(went to Dansville))
